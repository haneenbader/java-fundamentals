### Lab-01:Java Primitives and Control Flow

Finished Tasks :

1-Flipping Coins: Write a function called flipNHeads that accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row. Simulate coin flipping by choosing a random number between 0 and 1. Numbers below .5 are considered tails. Numbers at and above .5 are considered heads. Print out heads or tails on one line for each flip. Print It took FLIPS flips to flip N heads in a row. once n heads have been in a row.

2- Command Line Clock: Write a method clock that uses Java’s built-in LocalDateTime object to constantly print out the current time to the console, second by second. The program should run until someone manually kills it with CTRL-C or presses the “stop” button in their IDE. Each time should only be printed once. Your program should detect when the seconds increase and only print something out when the timestamp changes.

### Lab-02: Arrays, Loops, Imports, ArrayLists

Finished Tasks :

1- Rolling Dice: Write a method called roll that accepts an integer n and rolls a six-sided dice n times. The method should return an array containing the values of the rolls.

2- check if Contains Duplicates: Write a method called containsDuplicates that returns true or false depending on whether the array contains duplicate values.

3-Calculating Averages: Write a method that accepts an array of integers and calculates and returns the average of all the values in the array.

4- Lowest weekly Month Temperatures average temperatures for Seattle: Given an array of arrays calculate the average value for each array and return the array with the lowest average.

## Lab: 03 - Maps and File I/O
Finished Tasks :

1- Analyzing Weather Data
Use the October Seattle weather data . Iterate through all of the data to find the min and max values. Use a HashSet of type Integer to keep track of all the unique temperatures seen. Finally, iterate from the min temp to the max temp and create a String containing any temperature not seen during the month. Return that String.

2- Tallying Election
Write a function called tally that accepts a List of Strings representing votes and returns one string to show what got the most votes.

3- JavaScript Linter
Write a method that reads a JavaScript file with a given Path, and generates an error message whenever it finds a line that doesn’t end in a semi-colon.
